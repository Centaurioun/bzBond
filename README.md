### Web-focused quick start

#### Requirements

- [node/npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

#### Instructions

1. On the command line run `npx -y @beezwax/create-bzbond-app <project-name>`.<br>
E.g. `npx -y @beezwax/create-bzbond-app testing-bzbond`<br>
An all in one FileMaker/Web Project file with the same name as your project should open

## Usage

FileMaker/Claris Pro can harness the power of web technologies to enhance user and developer experience. bzBond provides tools to make it easier to do this. Here's some of the things you can do.

### Control web viewer scripting with promises

bzBond treats script calls from web viewers as promises, letting you chain them or use async/await.

In the code below we want to add the current user to a group. First we need to get their account name, then we want to add them to the group. To synchronize these operations we chain two scripts together, using the result of the first script in the parameter of the second script. The UI is update at each point in the process. 
```
// Get the UI html element to update
status = document.getElement("#status");
// Update the UI to show process is about to run 
status.textContent = "Adding user to group...";

// Run FileMaker scripts to add the current user to a group
// First FileMaker script gets the user's account name
bzBond.PerformScript("Get Account Name")
  .then(accountName => {

    // Update the UI with the result of the first FileMaker script
    status.textContent = `Account Name is ${accountName}`;

    // Second FileMaker script adds the user to the group "bzBuzz"
    bzBond.PerformScript("Add User To Group", {accountName, group: "bzBuzz"})
  })
  .then(groupSize => {

    // Update the UI with the result of the second FileMaker script
    status.textContent = `Group size is ${groupSize}`;
  });
```

### Add a JavaScript function runner to your scripts

In the script below we are sorting a JSON array, something that is complex to code and slow to run when done natively. With bzBond we are using just a few lines of JavaScript and the script takes only 250ms to run. Sorted!

#### Works on server!

With bzBond-server installed on FileMaker/Claris Server the will work on the Server without any changes. 


## The tools

### bzBond-js

bzBond-js is a javascript library that manages interactions between FileMaker/Claris Pro scripts and web viewer layout objects. It can be installed using the command `npm install @beezwax/bzbond-js`. bzBond-js calls the script bzBondRelay, which is in the [bzBond-claris.fmp12](#bzbond-claris) file.
